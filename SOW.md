# Scope of Work (SOW)

**Student:** Diana Lugo  
**Course:** C++ Programming – Summer 2025  
**Instructor:** Lakisha Brooks
**Submission Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Project Title:** *SweetTrackr* – A Baking Order Manager!

---

## Project Description

For my final project, I will build *SweetTrackr*, a C++ application that helps small home-based baking businesses manage customer orders and track basic inventory. The program will have a simple text-based interface where users can add, view, and delete orders. All data will be saved to and loaded from text files, meeting the requirement for long-term data storage.

## Purpose

As a first-generation Mexican-American college student who runs a home baking side hustle, I wanted to create something practical and personal. *SweetTrackr* will help users (like me) stay organized with orders and customer info. This project also gives me hands-on experience using C++ fundamentals like file handling, functions, and classes, while adding a meaningful piece to my programming portfolio.

## Planned Features

- Menu-based interface (Add Order, View Orders, Delete Order, Exit)  
- Customer order info: name, date, item, quantity  
- Save/load data using text files  
- Display all current orders in a readable format  

---

## Program Flow

User launches program → Menu appears → User selects an action → Data is input or displayed → Data is saved or updated in the file → Program loops or exits

---

## Tools & Technologies

- C++ (C++17 standard)  
- Visual Studio Code with g++ compiler  
- GitHub for version control  
- YouTube for project presentation and demo

---

## Timeline

- **July 1–5:** Plan program structure, create pseudocode and menu  
- **July 6–12:** Implement basic features and file handling  
- **July 13–18:** Add delete and display features, test thoroughly  
- **July 19–21:** Polish interface, finalize all code  
- **July 22–23:** Create presentation, record and upload YouTube demo  
- **July 23:** Submit final project and presentation

---

## Final Deliverables

- Well-documented C++ source code  
- GitHub repository with all files
- PowerPoint presentation with program overview, features, and code flow  
- YouTube video demoing the working program and presentation
